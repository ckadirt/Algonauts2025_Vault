## 📌 Overview
The Algonauts Challenge 2025 focuses on predicting human brain responses to complex naturalistic multimodal movies. Participants are tasked with developing computational models that can accurately predict fMRI responses during movie viewing. The challenge is based on data from the CNeuroMod dataset, which provides extensive fMRI recordings of subjects watching various movies.

## 📊 Data Resources

- **Training Data:** 65 hours of movie stimuli with corresponding fMRI responses, including:
    - Seasons 1–6 of "Friends"
    - Movies: "The Bourne Supremacy," "Hidden Figures," "Life," and "The Wolf of Wall Street"
- **Testing Data:** 10 hours of movie stimuli from "Friends" Season 7, with fMRI responses withheld for evaluation.
- **OOD Testing Data:** 2 hours of out of distribution movie data.

## 🎯 Team Objectives

- **Develop a Robust Encoding Model:** Create a model that predicts whole-brain responses to multimodal naturalistic stimuli and generalizes beyond the training data.
- **Ensure Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization:** Focus on the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data during the Model Selection Phase.
- **Promote Open Science:** Prepare a comprehensive report detailing our approach and make our code openly available, adhering to the challenge's guidelines.
